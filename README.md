# BirdSpawner Plugin
 
Currently compatible with Unreal Engine 5.3 <br />

Create a folder called 'Plugins' in the same folder where your UPROJECT file is found if a plugins folder does not already exist.
Copy and paste the 'BirdSpawner' folder (delete '-main' from the folder name) into that plugins folder. You may need to enable the plugin via Edit > Plugins from within your project.
